infer-cpp
=========

a set of (dumb) inference algorithms in c++

### Currently implemented
* k-means
* Gaussian Mixture Models (EM)

### TODO
* (easy) GMM multidimensional, variational inference
* (easy) robust GMMs: GMM+uniform distibution
* (hard) LLVM implementation of VMP (see e.g. https://github.com/psycharo/factor-graph/tree/vmp) AND EP
  * application-based, such as e.g. TrueSkill (c)
